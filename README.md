Skyrim Special Edition Mod Menu. 

Very much a WIP atm

It works on a vanilla installation of Skyrim Special Edition, OR a modded version using "CommunityShaders.dll". 

Specifically, I play with the "Gate to Sovngarde" modpack, with over 1400 mods, and my menu works like a charm. 
I havent tested other modded versions, but I tried my best to make the code use signatures instead of offsets, so hopefully it works with most game version and mod permutations.
