Skyrim Special Edition Mod Menu. 

Very much a WIP atm

It works on a vanilla installation of Skyrim Special Edition, OR a modded version using "CommunityShaders.dll". 

Specifically, I play with the "Gate to Sovngarde" modpack, with over 1400 mods, and my menu works like a charm. 
I havent tested other modded versions, but I tried my best to make the code use signatures instead of offsets, so hopefully it works with most game version and mod permutations.

As of writing this, it is pretty basic with only a few features. Unbreakable lockpicks, unlimited gold, speed hack, and a teleport all entities to player feature.

I will update the read me once the project has more notable features.
